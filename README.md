# Multisensory-Conditioning-Behavior

This repository contains the MATLAB code required for running the multisensory conditioning experiment and analysis. In addition to MATLAB, EthoVision XT is used to track motion of behavioral subjects. 

## How to Run Experiment

Open Multisensory_Conditioning_Assay_61917.m, which functions as the behavioral assay for the multisensory conditioning experiment. Input trial number in line 9, which should match the trial number in EthoVision. 

## How to Run Analysis
### Individual:

Use conditioning_analysis.m when analyzing individual trials. Input trial number in line 10 and the "marker" (time that first series of contrasting vertical bars appears in Multisensory_Conditioning_Assay_61917.m) in line 14. Run script. Output contains a graph 

### Combined:
